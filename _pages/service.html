## Service

I am a founding member of [the Sadie Collective](https://www.sadiecollective.org/) and currently serve as an Advisory Board Member, contributing to the organization’s strategy and mission.

At Cornell, I served on the executive board of the Black Graduate and Professional Students Association and the Graduate Students in Public Policy Association.
