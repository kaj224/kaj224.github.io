My research sits at the intersection of public finance, labor economics, and urban economics. I study how racial and demographic change shapes public goods provision, local policy decisions, and labor-market outcomes.

## Works in Progress

**Black Flight and Local Public Goods**  
Examines how Black suburbanization influences local public goods provision and institutional responses in suburban municipalities.

**The Impact of Manufacturing Decline on the New Great Migration**  
Studies how deindustrialization in Northern metros has shaped Black migration patterns and economic outcomes in Southern labor markets.
